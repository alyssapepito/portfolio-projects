# Data Science Portfolio by Alyssa Pepito
This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks, reports, and sql files which I created for data analysis or for exploration of machine learning algorithms.

## Data Exploration and Analysis

### Data Science Job Postings in Glassdoor
[Github](https://github.com/alyssapepito/portfolio-projects/blob/main/notebooks/Data_Science_Job_Postings.ipynb)<br /><br />
In this project, I used the dataset of Data Science Job Postings in Glassdoor from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/data-science-job-posting-on-glassdoor/data).
I wanted to practice data cleaning and transformation techniques using Python. I was able to remove duplicates, drop unnecessary columns, 
create new columns from the original data, fill null values, and standardize column values using replace.

### Youtube Comments Sentiment Analysis
[Github](https://github.com/alyssapepito/portfolio-projects/blob/main/notebooks/Sentiment_Analysis_Youtube_Comments.ipynb)<br /><br />
There was a sentiment analysis project I did back then and I wanted to try using youtube comments from one of Smosh's videos, 
specifically from their series Reading Reddit Stories. I thought it would be interesting if I could determine the emotional tone of the comments 
and how they feel about some of the stories being read.

### Worldwide Layoffs
[Github](https://github.com/alyssapepito/portfolio-projects/blob/main/sql/Layoffs_EDA.sql)<br /><br />
I had a dataset that consisted of layoffs from worldwide companies and I used SQL to clean,
filter, and aggregate this large dataset.

### AirBnB Listings Analysis
[Github](https://github.com/alyssapepito/portfolio-projects/blob/main/notebooks/AirBnb_Listings_Analysis.ipynb)<br /><br />
Using the AirBnb dataset, I wanted to understand the average price
trend, the rise and fall of new hosts, and the effect of the 2015
regulations to AirBnBs located in Sydney.

## Data Visualization using Tableau or Power BI

### Ratings Analytics on British Airways Reviews
[Github](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/alyssa.mae.pepito/viz/BritishAirwaysReview_17257173401180/Dashboard1)<br /><br />
While looking at projects to do, I stumbled upon Mo Chen's videos and noticed that the data he was using needed cleaning and transforming.
So I wanted to see how the Tableau dashboard would look like with a cleaned dataset.

### My Year of Gaming 2023
[Github](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/alyssa.mae.pepito/viz/MyYearofGaming2023/MyYearofGaming2023)<br /><br />
A personal project where I used data from Steam to reflect on my gaming history in 2023. 

### Netflix Rating Analytics
[Github](https://github.com/alyssapepito/portfolio-projects/blob/main/pbix/Netflix%20Analysis.pbix)<br /><br />
I found this dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snehaanbhawal/netflix-tv-shows-and-movie-list) and wanted to explore Power BI's intricacies. Design was heavily inspired by Power BI Bro.
